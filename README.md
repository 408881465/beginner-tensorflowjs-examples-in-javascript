Note to self:
When installing any tensorflowjs repository on cloud9 http://c9.io 
These steps work to generate a working dist folder

1. Open terminal in the demo folder you want to compile
1. nvm install 8
1. npm install
1. npm run build

Supposedly this should work but I always seem to have issues with it

1. In the main folder
1. nvm install 8
1. npm install yarn
1. Open terminal in the demo folder you want to compile
1. nvm install 8
1. yarn
1. yarn build
