This node server allows saving individual layers so that multiple computers can work in parrallel to train a multilayer model
Sept 8, 2018 Still a work in progress but is basically working.

Note I can't run this from github so people will have to load their own node server.

I made this on cloud 9 so not sure how it will work on your server.
