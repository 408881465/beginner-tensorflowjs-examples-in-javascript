Update:  I think posenet does now have a form of version control

https://unpkg.com/@tensorflow-models/posenet@1.0.3/dist/posenet.min.js

unfortunately I think that breaks my present version.




Posenet does not seem to have version control at the moment so here are 2 backup js files

posenet.v011.min   is for tensorflowjs version 0.11.4


posenet-for-tfjs104-min  for tfjs version 1.0.4
